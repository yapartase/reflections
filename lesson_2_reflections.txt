>>What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

a .git folder is created which will include my future commits.

>>How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working area is where your files would come from which you want to commit.
You place them in the staging area to later commit them.

>>How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

not so sure yet.

>>What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?

when you want to test some ideas without affecting the main branch. You can
merge at a later point.

>>What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent
it in the diagram the way we do?

If you merge two branches the files in those branches will firstly be compared
with eachother. Lines which were present in the initial file but are no longer present in one of the later files
will not be present in the final file. Lines which were not present in the initial file but were added later will be added
in the final file. Lines which where present in the initial file and are also present in later files will be added
in the final file.
