>>What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

a .git folder is created which will include my future commits.

>>How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working area is where your files would come from which you want to commit.
You place them in the staging area to later commit them.
